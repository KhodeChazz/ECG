# ECG Analysis Toolkit 🫀

![ECG Example](https://github.com/yourusername/ecg-analysis/raw/main/images/ecg_example.png)  
*Example ECG signal with detected abnormalities*

A comprehensive Python toolkit for processing, analyzing, and visualizing Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals, with special focus on arrhythmia detection and ST-segment analysis.

## 🔍 Project Overview

This toolkit provides:

- **Automated processing** of raw ECG signals from MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database
- **Machine learning-powered** arrhythmia detection using CNN-LSTM models
- **ST-segment analysis** for potential heart attack detection
- **Interactive visualization** tools for clinical and research applications

Key features:
- End-to-end pipeline from raw data to clinical insights
- Modular, object-oriented design for easy extension
- Pre-trained models for immediate use
- Comprehensive visualization capabilities
